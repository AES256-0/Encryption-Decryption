About: A simple encryption-decryption tool that will encrypt your file using AES(Advanced Encryption Algorithm) in CCM mode.
       It is written in Python3.7.

Requirements: Python3.7 need to be installed on your system.
             
How it works: For encryption: simply run,
                              #python3.7 encryption.py
              
              For decryption: run,
                              #python3.7 decryption.py   
                              
Future features: Other Algorithms will be added.
